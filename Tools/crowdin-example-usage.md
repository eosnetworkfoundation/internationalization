# Crowdin Example Translation 

## Links to Dashboard
The following link to translations that live in my [forked repo](https://github.com/ericpassmore/internationalization/tree/ericpassmore-working). The repo is forked becuase I needed to grant crowdin read/write access to the repositories. Safer to do that with my own working copy, and not with eosnetworkfoundation repos.  

Translations will end up in a new branch in the [ericpassmore cloned repository](https://github.com/ericpassmore/internationalization/tree/i10n-sample-translations)
