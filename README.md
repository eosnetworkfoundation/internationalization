Internationalization the tools, processes, goals, priorities, and translation resources 

## Media and Content Types

Currently Blog posts and 

| Category | Process | Tools |
| -------- | ------- | ----- |
| Grant Applications | Applicaton from Github, translated by an external team into another document | Unknown | 
| Blog Articles | Articles in WordPress, duplicate WP posts in other languages. An External team edits non-en language posts directly  | WPML | 
| Interview | Unknow | Unknow |
| Developer Docs | Emerging Process | None Selected | 

### Grant Applications 
Grant Applications are translated to Chinese and English for board reivew. The proposal process is in English

### Blog Articles
Blog content is simultanously released in multiple languages. Drafts are written in English and translated into new posts.

### Interviews
Interviews are released in English, and are not translated unless there is significant demand for the content. 

For Chinese the external 3rd party manages its own YouTube channel, and selects which video content to translate. 

For Korean, there are some community members who manage their own channel where they post their own localized content as well as sub-titled videos from ENF as well as other entities within EOS [https://www.youtube.com/EOSTOKEN](https://www.youtube.com/EOSTOKEN)


### Developer Docs
The process and goals are still being worked on.

## Etherum as a Benchmark

As of July 28th 2022 Etherum Claims
* 3,600 + translators
* 46 languages live on site
* 2.9 million words translated in 2021
* 1.5 million words translated in 2022 so far

Etherum translates their developer documentation, and content. 

* [ZH Developer Docs](https://ethereum.org/zh/developers/docs/)
* [KO Developer Docs](https://ethereum.org/ko/developers/docs/)

[Etherum has a translation program](https://ethereum.org/en/contributing/translation-program/), and if you scroll down to the bottom of the page you may select a language and enter the Crowdin tranlation portal. 

Etherum makes use of many tools; however [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) is prometly featured in their translation site. 

### Etherum Reviews
Community translations are reviewed by a professional translation team. Etherum uses [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) which allows for a 2-pass review process. First translation by the community, and followed by a professional review. The professional review only occures after the community reaches 100% translation for a file. 

### Etherum Bounties
Etherum may be offering bounties for translations. From looking at the [Etherum translation program](https://ethereum.org/en/contributing/translation-program/) the community translations are done pro-bono. 

## Term Glossary
For translations a Term Glossary is very important. Translating engineering and technical documenation requires both language expertise and engineering expertise. A term glossary stores a mapping of terms between languages. Leveraging a term glossary
* Enables language experts to get the right engineering terms.
* Enables engineering experts to automate first pass translations of specific technical terms. 
* Reduces rework by sharing good translatons across content and media types

See this [2013 Paper from Lion Bridge on Translation Glossary](http://info.lionbridge.com/rs/lionbridge/images/Lionbridge%20FAQ_Glossary_2013.pdf)

## Tooling
The wordpress blogs utlizie WPML. Unfortunetly term glossaries are not easy to export, share, or collaborate across media types.
